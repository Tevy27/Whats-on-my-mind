        <p>In the stillness of night, when voices fade and the world outside grows quiet, my mother carries her heaviest thoughts. She does not speak them; she keeps them locked inside, but I see the way her eyes dim when she thinks of her brothers.</p>

<p>She believes she is responsible for them. She believes their broken lives are somehow her fault. One of them, already fifty, has wasted his years chasing drugs. His health is gone, his blood sick, his body thin and fragile. He has no steady work, no money, and no reason to keep going except to ask others for help. And each time he reaches out, my mother answers, even though it cuts her deeper each time.</p>

<p>She does not have an income of her own. She is cared for, her needs are met, yet when her brother demands money, she cannot give from herself. She has to reach outward, asking from others so she can pass it on to him. It weighs on her dignity, though she rarely admits it. I know it hurts her, yet the guilt inside her whispers that she owes him, that she must not let him fall.</p>

<p>But I see the truth she cannot face. His life is not hers to fix. His ruin is not her burden. He chose his path; he chose the drugs; he chose to waste his strength. Now, when there is little left of him, he turns to her as if she were the reason for his collapse. And she believes it. She believes his failures are the shadow of her own mistakes.</p>

<p>It makes me angry, though I keep it hidden. Angry that she blames herself for what was never her doing. Angry that she bends under the weight of his demands while he takes without shame. Angry that her soft heart, which should be protected, is bruised again and again by someone who has given nothing back.</p>

<p>These are feelings I do not speak aloud. To tell her would only deepen her sorrow, and she already carries too much. So I hold my anger in silence, watching her give away what little she has, watching her carry the guilt of a man who never deserved her sacrifice.</p>

<p>What I wish she could see is simple. She has already given enough. She does not owe him her peace, her tears, or her dignity. His story is his own, and hers should not be chained to it. But I know she may never see it that way. She will go on carrying the guilt, because that is who she is. And I will go on loving her quietly, even as I ache with the anger she cannot bring herself to feel.</p>
