        <p>In a small home in the middle of a busy city, a woman lived a life filled with quiet strength. Her days revolved around her four daughters, each one bringing light into her world. They were kind, thoughtful, and always there for her. They carried her burdens without complaint, wrapping her in the warmth of their love. Their presence gave her peace, her pride, and her joy.</p>

<p>But not everyone in her life was like them. Her brothers, once her childhood playmates, had grown into strangers. They only came to her when they wanted something, treating her not as a sister but as a source of convenience. Their words were empty, their visits rare, and their hearts seemed distant. They didn’t see her struggles, only what they could take from her.</p>

<p>When illness took her to a hospital bed, her daughters never left her side. Their love was steady, their care constant. But her brothers stayed away. One was silent, caught up in his own life. The other did call, but not to ask how she was. Instead, he wanted money for a new motorbike. The request cut her deeply, leaving her heart heavy with disbelief.</p>

<p>The demands for money kept coming, adding to her worries. At night, as the world slept, she lay awake, tears quietly slipping down her cheeks. She didn’t want to burden her daughters with the selfishness of her brothers. They had already given her so much, and she couldn’t bear to see their love overshadowed by others’ greed.</p>

<p>She often wondered how things had turned out this way. How could her brothers, bound to her by the same family ties, be so different from her daughters? Her daughters gave her love and peace, while her brothers only brought pain. But even in her sadness, she found strength. She decided to protect what mattered most: the love of her daughters.</p>

<p>That love was her treasure. It was enough to fill the empty spaces left by disappointment. It was a wealth that no one could take from her, a light that would always shine, no matter the shadows around her.</p>
