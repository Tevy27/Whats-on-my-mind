        <p>It was a little after 5 a.m. when a terrified scream startled me awake. I thought it was another one of my sister’s usual panicked reactions to a centipede or some other harmless creature. But something about this scream felt different—deeper, more desperate.
I rushed out of my room, my heart pounding. My bedroom is right by the stairs, and as I stepped into the hallway, time seemed to freeze. There she was—my sister—crying, her face pale, eyes wide with terror, staring up the staircase.
I followed her gaze and felt my heart stop. My grandmother was hanging from the top of the stairs.
Everything after that moved in a blur. My father rushed forward, hands trembling as he frantically tried to untie the rope. We pulled her down, laying her fragile body on the floor. Without a second thought, we began CPR, desperately hoping to revive her, though we had no idea how long she had been up there. Every breath felt like an eternity, the eerie sound of air escaping her lungs echoing in the room. We clung to the tiny hope that it was a sign she might still be alive.
But deep down, we knew.
Minutes passed, though they felt like hours, before we finally gave up. The crushing weight of reality settled in. My dad sat down in a nearby chair, his face pale, breathing heavily. His hand clutched at his chest as he gasped for air, shaking uncontrollably. He was having a panic attack. We rushed over, terrified that he might be having a heart attack. We were trying to calm him down, telling him to breathe. After a few minutes, his breathing steadied, and the colour slowly returned to his face.
We stared at her lifeless body for a while before discussing what to do next. 
We knew why she did it, or at least we thought we did. Her illness had taken over her life. Every day, she was in pain, suffering silently. Maybe she couldn’t bear it anymore, or perhaps she feared being a financial burden with the cost of her medication. We’ll never fully understand her reasons.
My mom, though, she hasn’t been the same since. Guilt consumes her. She wishes she had paid more attention to her mother’s suffering, taken her illness more seriously. She’s haunted by the things she didn’t do, the care she didn’t give. Watching her, heartbroken, unable to forgive herself, tears me apart. It’s like a wound that will never heal.
My grandmother is gone, and with her, the pain she endured. But the ones she left behind—we’re still here, carrying the weight of that day. The regrets, the what-ifs—they follow us. And though time may soften the grief, it never erases the memories.</p>
