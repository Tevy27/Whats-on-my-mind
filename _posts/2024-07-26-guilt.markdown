His life began with promise; a university student with dreams as wide as the sky above his small town. That sky once filled him with hope, but one night it became a dark cover hiding his ruin.

The evening had been alive with music and laughter. Friends gathered, drinks poured freely, and the energy of youth made him feel untouchable. The more he drank, the more he believed nothing could harm him. By the end of the night, unsteady on his feet, he convinced himself he could drive. The roads were quiet, and his home was close.
Inside the car, the world blurred. Streetlights smeared into streaks of colour, and the wheel felt heavy in his hands. On the seat beside him lay an empty bottle, rolling as the car swayed.

Then it happened. Ahead, a motorbike carried a small family—two parents and their child clinging to the middle. He saw them too late. The impact was sudden and sickening. The motorbike toppled, the parents thrown, the child struck hardest. The scene froze in his mind, a picture of horror carved into memory.

Instead of helping, fear drove him. His mind raced with what would happen if he stayed. Prison, shame, his future gone. In his country, with enough money, new names and new papers were possible. He chose escape. Within days, he had sold what he could, paid the right people, and disappeared. The boy was buried while he was boarding a plane.

Abroad, life became a shadow of itself. He changed his name and found work, but nothing felt real. The sun never seemed bright enough. Each drink reminded him of the bottle beside the passenger seat, each sound of children’s laughter twisted like a knife in his chest.
Crowded rooms made him feel more alone. He smiled when required, but the mask was brittle; every laugh from others grated against the silence inside him. At night, in his rented rooms, the darkness felt lighter than the weight pressing on his soul.

The child’s face followed him everywhere. On the bus, in the crowd, even in his dreams. He tried to live, but he was not living—only haunting himself. Strangers knew him by a false name, yet inside he was still the man who ran from the broken body of a child.

Years passed, but the guilt did not weaken; it grew. Every morning was punishment, every night a reminder. He was prisoner to a secret that rotted his spirit. In the end, there was no need for bars or judges. His guilt consumed him, leaving only a hollow man, fading quietly into nothing.
